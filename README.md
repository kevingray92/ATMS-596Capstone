# ATMS-596 Capstone
Online Capstone instructor files.

Give an overview of your capstone here: The Online Capstone is the last big project conducted by online master's students. We provided a weekly meeting with students as part of this course. During our weekly meeting, essential research skills were presented and practiced. This repository holds some of the example code presented during our weekly meetings.

Files:

**ViewUpdraft.ipynb**  Code used to take horizontal and vertical slices through some CM1 output.

**ViewUpdraft_BlankCopy.ipynb**  The same as above, but only comments are provided so that students could write in the code themselves as they follow along with the instructor.

**ViewUpdraft_withOutput.ipynb**  Used to demonstrate that you should run the code before uploading it to GitHub if you want output/plots to be visible.

**GriddingObs.ipynb**  Adapted code from a MetPy cookbook demonstrating how to regrid unevenly spaced observations.

**ViewAnomalies.ipynb**  Code used to open ERA5 grib files containing monthly average wind and wave information in the decade leading up to the wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald and compute anomalies using hourly data valid at the time of the wreck.

**ERA5Hourly.grib**  A grib file holding ERA5 wind and wave information every 6 hours around the time of the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

**ERA5MonthlyAveraged.grib**  A grib file holding ERA5 wind and wave information averaged for the month of Nov in the years from 1965-1975.
